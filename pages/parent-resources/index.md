# Parent Resources

### TRANSPORTATION

Compass purposely chose a building that was centrally located and linked to our public transportation system in Fort Collins.&nbsp; These should be the number one means of getting Compass students to school.

* BIKE: We are right next to the&nbsp;[Spring Creek bike trail](https://www.fcgov.com/bicycling/pdf/bike-map-front.pdf){: target="_blank"}. which connects most of Fort Collins.
* BUS: We are adjacent to the Spring Creek&nbsp;[MAX](http://www.ridetransfort.com/max){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;station.&nbsp; Take the MAX from home to school, connect through other&nbsp;[TRANSFORT](http://www.ridetransfort.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;routes, or consider parking at another MAXstop.&nbsp; Youth 17 and under ride the MAX for free.
* CAR: We realize that there are times you will be driving your student to school.&nbsp; See attached drop off routes for more information.&nbsp; Students will not be allowed to drive to Compass.&nbsp;
