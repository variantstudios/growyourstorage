# Parents

## Parents get to play a part!

It is our belief that welcoming and partnering with families is part of what will make our climate and culture exceptional. Parents know the value of a great education for their children. It is our goal to help your child thrive in a school environment that is tailored to build on their strengths and passions.

All new students will complete an interview and skills assessment to make sure our staff will effectively meet the needs of each individual as they create their learning plan.

We want your involvement and partnership in our school. In addition to being a participant in the students’ three times/year Presentations of Learning (student led conferences), we hope you will help us connect students to internships in the community. Additionally, we will also welcome families to evening classes to learn English, computer skills, and tricks of the trade in the difficult job of parenting adolescents. We value your role as a parent and want to be an extension of your encouragement for your child to be a powerful, positive change maker in our community and our world.

### THE PAC (Parents Action Council)

The PAC is a group of parents who meet the first Monday of every month. &nbsp;The PAC helps parents stay informed about everything Compass, works to improve school culture, and is a vital resource for community building. &nbsp;Consider joining this amazing group of Compass parents. &nbsp;You can stay informed of their activities via the website, join the closed Facebook group with only Compass parents and caregivers, and link to their calendar.

Partnering with families is part of what will make our climate and culture exceptional. In addition to being part of our Presentations of Learning (student led conferences) three times a year, we will also welcome our families to evening classes to learn English, computer skills, and tricks of the trade in the difficult job of parenting. Additionally, parents will be an important connection to the working world by offering internships, project ideas, business connections, and expertise for our students. Other classes and opportunities for parents and families will be created on a year-by-year basis in response to family needs and interests.

One of our highest priorities at Compass is to take care of our families; we welcome ideas and opportunities to make your student’s success a family affair.
