# A Day in the Life

![](/assets/images/day-in-the-life.png)

At Compass, our schedule is different to facilitate our innovative educational model.

* Families choose one of three start times with a corresponding end time.&nbsp; This lets teens get the sleep they need, and helps bring studentâ€™s schedules more in line with family needs.
* Compass students have individualized mathematics and English instruction with [Summit Learning Platform](https://www.summitlearning.org/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;at the beginning and/or end of the day.&nbsp; Certified teachers are always available for personal coaching.
* Large, flexible blocks of time allow for students to make the most of their [Venture Projects](/venture-projects/).&nbsp; The longer blocks of time facilitates cooperation with our community partners, and allows plenty of time for college courses and internships.
