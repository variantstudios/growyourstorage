In Daniel Pink’s seminal book, Drive, published in 2009, he reveals three critical elements of motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.  It’s no coincidence that “helping students discover learning with purpose….” is part of our mission statement for Compass High School.

Just this month, there have been interviews all over the news with Angela Duckworthy, author of her newly published book, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.  In this book, book she outlines what she learned in her study of “grit”, the determination to get hard things done and to become great at something you care about. The secret; passion for what you are doing!

These authors and so many more have showed us conclusively what motivates humans. At Compass High School, our model of community-based, interdisciplinary, student-driven education is all about tapping into those primary needs for autonomy, mastery, purpose…. and we’ll add one more: community (belonging).

## "Why do we have to learn this?"" are words we never hear at Compass High School
