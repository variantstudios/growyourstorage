# GYS General Contracting

### About Us

GYS General Contracting was established August 2nd of 2016. However, the body of experience behind it’s inception goes back decades. Lee Frederick (see complete Bio below), has been in the self storage industry for decades, and his experience informs the entire approach of the general contracting business. Every decision made or not made is directed at an end product that improves the user experience of our facilities – and the user experience directly translates to return renters.

While GYS General Contracting (GYS GC) is focused on building self storage facilities, the collective experience of the executive team touches on a diverse range of construction projects. Between David Harvey and Brandon Grebe alone (See full bios below) GYS GC has experience managing office, multi-family, retail, restaurants, R&D labs, mixed use buildings, hangar space, flex/warehouse, industrial space, a whiskey distillation facility, boutique Inn, private resort projects, medical office, large scale civil, super-markets and churches. With this broad spectrum of experience GYS GC can handle any construction project, but is equipped to handle self storage projects with a mastery specific to GYS GC.

Outside of the collective core competencies of the GYS GC team, there is the overriding company philosophy, which again, is aimed at understanding the owner/developer’s perspective. The owner/developer needs accurate, current, and honest communication about their projects. GYS GC will not over-promise and under-deliver, instead they will aggressively pursue the owner’s interest with a degree of transparency and clarity atypical of the construction industry.

The GYS GC business model is aimed at service and efficiency – our clients do not pay for exaggerated overhead. When negotiating the final contracts for a project, clients can see that part of GYS GC’s competitive pricing is paying only for the tools essential to managing the construction project. Nonetheless, the processes and procedures, the software and document control employed here were developed to compete with the largest construction firms today.

Regardless of the project – GYS GC can help.

*GYS GC TEAM: I am just going to recycle our bios, but want to do this in concert with what you are posting on the development side…*
