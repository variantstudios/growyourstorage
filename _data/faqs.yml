This may be a credit-bearing, online course from any university in the country, or a classroom course at FRCC or CSU. We believe that students need to experience a college course before they leave high school in order to be best prepared and feel confident in their skills to attend college.</p><p>Students will graduate with a web-based portfolio of work to demonstrate both their academic skills and their 21st Century skills mastery. They will also have a professional resume and a letter of reference from a professional with whom they completed an extensive job internship.

    - question: Why is Compass using a different model for assessing and transcripting student work?
      answer_html: '<p>In our rapidly changing world, we believe that equipping students with the skills to be lifelong learners and positive change-makers is our number one job. Students will learn Colorado core content standards with the help of certified, highly-qualified teachers. However, they will learn these standards at different times, in a multitude of ways, throughout their years at Compass High School.In order to keep students from focusing on grades instead of learning, they will build a professional portfolio of their learning products and earn degrees inside eight, skill-focused digital badges while they are working at Compass High School. Ultimately, academic work will be assigned grades based on competency levels attained so that students will have transcripts for other schools, but this is not the form of feedback we will use as students demonstrate their learning.</p>'

There will also be training for our students and community mentors about appropriate and professional expectations, including the need for all students to be in common spaces (where other people will be around) with their mentors.</p><p>Older students may be independently traveling on public transportation to their satellite campuses and internships. Parents will sign a blanket permission slip at the beginning of each semester when the student designs their plan of learning with their Compass advisor to allow this travel and work outside of our school building. Parents will have contact information for the alternate learning locations and students will be required to wear a chipped badge at all times when they are off campus. The chipped badge will allow administrators at the school to locate the student if there is any question as to their whereabouts (this is like the software that Apple uses in their &ldquo;find my iphone app&rdquo;).</p>'
