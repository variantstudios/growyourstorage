  position: School Leader
  bio: "While I have had many job titles over the course of my career, the thread that binds them together is my passion for learning. I have three master’s degrees, two in science and one in Educational Leadership, as well as a principal’s license. I have \_been a dedicated public educator for fourteen years in Fort Collins, serving as a high school classroom teacher, a department leader, a Dean of Students, and as a district-wide high school interventions facilitator.\n\nI became a teacher to change the world. What better way to create a more just and humane planet for all of us than to help orchestrate a rich learning ecosystem that inspires creativity, develops intellect, and fosters compassionate action around the globe? My commitment to social justice and to public education as a critical foundation for our democracy are matched by my responsiveness to data, research, and the educational demands of our rapidly changing world. As a clear, open, and trustworthy communicator, I will effectively lead Compass Community Collaborative School through its startup years with the partnership of an experienced, highly qualified, and committed team that will ensure that Compass stays student-centered and mission-driven. I am honored to be facilitating the work of a team of creative, thoughtful, and energetic change agents who are committed to writing the next chapter in public education. Compass Community Collaborative School is revolutionizing education for students, for their families, for the city of Fort Collins, and for the world."

  position: Assistant School Leader
  bio: "As a public educator in Fort Collins for the past eighteen years, I’ve always been focused on not just my students’ learning, but my own. I believe that the best teachers are also lifelong students, which is one of the reasons I’m drawn to the work we are doing at Compass Community Collaborative School. I’ve worked as an International Baccalaureate Program Coordinator for the past decade as well as an IB Workshop Leader, Consultant and Program Evaluator working with schools all over North America. My collaborative spirit and desire for learning has also led to my work with the Colorado State University Writing Project, a professional organization of teachers working to improve writing and communication skills in K-12 students on the Front Range. This has reinforced my desire to break down walls of traditional discrete subject courses (science, math, history, etc.) and help kids see that education is greater and more powerful than what they often learn in the traditional classroom. Yet no experience has had a greater impact on my view of education than my work as a teacher of high school epistemology – the study of knowledge – for the past decade. \_Leading students through this course helped solidify my understanding of the power of self in the learning process. To understand the world around you, it is first important to understand yourself; how your personal experiences and beliefs impact the way you see and interpret your world. This honoring of identity and the power of each individual student is at the center of my teaching philosophy and our work at Compass."

    I am an educational psychologist and trainer in Emotional Intelligence (EI)
    and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), a parenting coach, and conflict
    mediator. I work with individuals, couples, families, schools, and
    organizations to foster the skills necessary to create and sustain mutually
    beneficial relationships and make optimal decisions in an ever changing
    world. I believe that we teach who we are and that learning happens best
    when intentional efforts are made to foster the social and emotional lives
    of children and their teachers. I know I am joined with my Compass
    colleagues in the commitment to helping our students and each other continue
    to develop these skills.


    I am certified with Six Seconds Emotional Intelligence Network to deliver
    the Self-Science and EQ Matters curricula and SEI Emotional Intelligence
    Assessments and with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence to deliver
    the Anchors of Emotional Intelligence curriculum. I hold an alternative

  position: Science/Math Teacher
  bio: >-
    I have been a teacher in Fort Collins for four years. Over the last three
    years I have worked to bring more opportunities to my students by creating
    projects such as bringing in CSU ecology students to mentor students on an
    authentic ecology research project, launching weather balloons, engineering
    devices to clean unsafe water, and building electrical power generators. I
    have searched out a variety of roles outside of the classroom to continue
    building positive relationships with students. I have been a soccer coach, a
    club sponsor, and last year I coordinated a trip with students to the
    Galapagos and Ecuador. I look forward to continuing my learning and my
    travels with students at Compass by organizing international trips, outdoor
    excursions and other exciting, immersive experiences for our students. Last
    summer I was able to teach the prototype for Compass with a terrific group
    of kids. The process of teaching students about climate change, writing and
    the art of filmmaking was great fun and very affirming of our educational
    model. I believe that students need a place where they not only are having
    authentic, personally engaging experiences, but where their voices matter
    and they feel like they belong; I look forward to creating that culture at
    Compass Community Collaborative School.

  position: English Teacher
  bio: >-
    I was fortunate to be hired for an English teacher position in Poudre School
    District immediately after completing my bachelors degree at Colorado State
    University. Being a young teacher was both challenging and rewarding, but
    what I discovered early on in my career was that I had something to learn
    from every student I taught. Each student’s unique story became a part of my
    own story as we built relationships together. Now, twelve years later I have
    interacted with students in a variety of different settings: as an
    International Baccalaureate and general education teacher, as a coach and
    dance teacher, as a theater choreographer, as a sponsor for poetry and
    service clubs, as a Compass summer prototype teacher. In that time, I also
    become a parent to two remarkable children. In each of these diverse
    settings, I realized that kids want to tell their stories in one form or
    another. As teachers, we have the privilege to be co-creators in these
    narratives, and our responsibility is to learn to listen carefully and
    compassionately to our youth. With this idea in mind, I am passionate about
    fostering opportunities for ALL people to find their voice, and what better
    vehicle than through teaching the craft of writing? As a CCC teacher, I am
    dedicated to researching and implementing the best methods to help students
    find their voices. My current Masters in English thesis digs deeper into how
    we can best support students to voice their ideas and help shape these ideas
    into realities. I look forward to listening, working, collaborating, and
    ultimately building relationships with the future students of Compass
    Community Collaborative.

  position: Mathematics and Computer Science Teacher
  bio: >-
    After working as a software engineer for almost a decade, I followed my
    heart and became a math, science, and technology teacher in Poudre School
    District. I’ve been a middle school teacher for my entire teaching career
    and I enjoy working with students as they grow into who they are as people
    and learners. During my time attending conferences, interacting with other
    educators online, experimenting with my own teaching and getting to visit
    other schools and classrooms, I became passionate about learner-centered
    education. I always enjoy working on rich and authentic projects with my
    students, and I can’t wait to make this kind of learning my full-time job. I
    am a lifelong learner myself.

    I’m a fellow in the National Education Association’s Teacher Leadership
    Initiative, and I was the Fort Collins Rotary Clubs’ PSD Teacher of the Year
    in 2012. I became an Allen Distinguished Educator in 2016, an opportunity
    awarded to teachers with innovative programs in Engineering, Computer
    Science, and Entrepreneurship. I make light-up, musical Ugly Christmas
    Sweaters every year in addition to other geeky crafts. I’m looking forward
    to being creative along with our incredible Compass students!

  position: Social Studies Teacher
  bio: >-
    After graduating from Kent State University, I moved to Colorado to fulfill
    a year-long volunteer service commitment.  Ultimately, I was hired to
    develop an adolescent program for a homeless shelter, and it was in that
    role of teen advocate and school liaison that I decided I wanted to be a
    teacher. I saw first-hand that having an adult who believed in them was
    essential to positively changing the trajectory of children’s lives. 
    Equally important,  I wanted to inspire in children a desire to learn.  As a
    result, I earned a Post-Bachelor’s Teaching Certificate in Secondary
    Education and a Masters of Education in Instructional Leadership from
    Colorado State University. I spent the next 15 years teaching social
    studies, and while I taught core courses (American History, World History,
    Civics, Sociology), I spent the majority of my career teaching both Advanced
    Psychology and International Baccalaureate Psychology.  I served as Exam
    Reader/Grader for the The College Board and Examiner/Moderator for the
    International Baccalaureate World School and was the recipient of Poudre
    School District’s Excellence in Education Award.  My entrepreneurial spirit
    led me to start my own business and most recently be a project coordinator
    in Larimer County connecting systems for young children’s social-emotional
    development.  Now, I am quite excited to return to where my main passion
    lies, teaching. I am dedicated to Compass Community Collaborative School’s
    mission and trust that our student-centered, meta-learning approach to
    education is the most powerful way we can support students in becoming their
    most authentic selves.

    In 2002 I got a job working with adults with developmental disabilities,
    with an emphasis on community accessibility and recreation. For more than
    ten years I worked with these incredible individuals and it changed my life.
    I learned how to be patient and practice gratitude in every endeavor in my
    life. Working with adults with disabilities taught me how to make a
    contribution in people’s lives. In 2011 I graduated from The University of
    Northern Colorado with a Master’s Degree in Special Education. I began
    working as a special education teacher at Reflections for Youth in Loveland
    while attending graduate school full time. I also worked in middle schools
    focusing on significant emotional disabilities and Autism. For the last two
    years I worked as a Social Worker for a Guardian Ad Litem and did one to one
    mental health therapy. I learned how the system affects disenfranchised
    youth and families and want to work hard to make sure that our students and
    families don’t fall through the cracks. I am excited to see how our team
    teaching and venture project model can benefit from my experience in special
    education and my love for learning. I look forward to sharing ideas with
    students and teachers, and to make this school an incredible opportunity for
    growth. I have been an active member in the community and can help build
    bridges with professional organizations and creative individuals. I believe
    that students deserve to be heard and the ability to study what interests
    them. Students should enjoy going to school everyday instead of dreading it.

    I received my Master’s Degree in Teaching and English Education from
    Teachers College, Columbia University, and taught at multiple levels of both
    middle and high school, in New York and New Jersey, before our family made
    the move to Colorado. Holistically, my time at Columbia as student, teacher,
    curriculum-geek, and all-round education enthusiast, refined my educational
    philosophy and shaped my vision of education in the 21st century. I believe
    scholarship must be accessible to students of every background, ability,
    learning style, and modality. I believe excellence in education is based on
    maintaining a balance among academic rigor, creativity, and plain old fun-
    through which the urge to inquire about our world and delve into
    self-discovery is nurtured and valued. I believe in dynamic, experiential,
    and interdependent learning that fosters solid relationships among students
    and their peers as well as with teachers, the local community, and the
    greater society at large. The educational culture and approaches to
    curriculum that we are crafting at Compass will enact these beliefs. Sir Ken
    Robinson put it best when he wrote, “We have to recognize that human
    flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you
    cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do, like a
    farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish.”
    Compass Community Collaborative school is a ripe and fertile landscape to
    nurture the growth of the students of Fort Collins, and will undoubtedly
    become the benchmark model for educational innovation nationwide.
