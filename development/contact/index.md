### Lee Fredrick

Lee provides the executive management for the company. He has delivered property management services for between two and 13 self-storage facilities since 1996. At that time, he was also managing Fredrick Enterprises, Inc. dba Credit Bureau of Lufkin; this family-owned business was an Experian affiliate serving the central east Texas region. In the 90’s, each of the self-storage properties operated independently and operating procedures lacked uniformity. For five years, he worked to develop consistent procedures by sharing the most effective operating strategies at each location. After selling the Credit Bureau in 2002, he has focused exclusively on the improvement and growth of our self storage operations.

Lee Fredrick graduated from the University of Dallas in 1986. He received Master’s degrees from Duquesne University and the Florida State University. His area of specialization is industrial and organizational psychology, and he makes use of this background in facilitating managers to have more productive and satisfying work experiences. He has also earned his LEED Accredited Professional designation from the United States Green Building Council. He has worked in the self-storage business since 1995, and he has worked at all levels of operations, from negotiating purchases to sweeping out units. Lee coordinates with the operations officer on oversight of all store managers, and he manages the financial operations of the company. He also conducts the feasibility studies for acquisitions or new developments and he provides oversight on the construction of new facilities.
