### Lee Fredrick

Email: Lee@gysdev.com

Cell: 936-671-1422

Lee provides the executive management for the company. He has delivered property management services for between two and 13 self-storage facilities since 1996. At that time, he was also managing Fredrick Enterprises, Inc. dba Credit Bureau of Lufkin; this family-owned business was an Experian affiliate serving the central east Texas region. In the 90’s, each of the self-storage properties operated independently and operating procedures lacked uniformity. For five years, he worked to develop consistent procedures by sharing the most effective operating strategies at each location. After selling the Credit Bureau in 2002, he has focused exclusively on the improvement and growth of our self storage operations.

Lee Fredrick graduated from the University of Dallas in 1986. He received Master’s degrees from Duquesne University and the Florida State University. His area of specialization is industrial and organizational psychology, and he makes use of this background in facilitating managers to have more productive and satisfying work experiences. He has also earned his LEED Accredited Professional designation from the United States Green Building Council. He has worked in the self-storage business since 1995, and he has worked at all levels of operations, from negotiating purchases to sweeping out units. Lee coordinates with the operations officer on oversight of all store managers, and he manages the financial operations of the company. He also conducts the feasibility studies for acquisitions or new developments and he provides oversight on the construction of new facilities.

### Mike Perry

Email: Mike@gysdev.com

Cell: 720-232-1383

Mike Perry joined GYS in the spring of 2019 as a managing partner with the primary focus of sourcing and capitalizing self-storage acquisitions.&nbsp; Mike has been involved in various roles in the self-storage industry since 2003.

Mike started his career as a certified public accountant with a Denver based audit firm serving real estate and oil and gas clients.&nbsp; After ten years in public accounting, Mike joined National Storage Affiliates Trust (currently the third largest publicly traded self-storage REIT, “NSA,” NYSE: NSA) prior to NSA launching its Initial Public Offering in 2015.&nbsp; Mike worked extensively on the financial reporting leading up to the company’s IPO as the controller which included overseeing the merger of several large privately held self-storage portfolios and the SEC reporting related to the public offering.

After NSA’s IPO, Mike transitioned out of the accounting role and become the company’s Vice President of Acquisitions.&nbsp; Between early 2015 and 2019, Mike played a key role in the company’s unprecedented volume of acquisitions closing over $3.5 billion of self-storage properties ranging from numerous single asset acquisitions to multiple large portfolio transactions ($100m - $200m) and two large joint venture acquisitions (2016 – 66 property $650m & 2018 112 property $1.3b).&nbsp; Mike has cultivated a broad network of relationships in the self-storage industry both with owners and operators as well as the self-storage broker community.

Mike has a passion for connecting on a personal level with self-storage owners ranging from the single asset owner to large institutional owners.&nbsp; His philosophy is based on building a relationship of trust with sellers by not committing to more that can be reasonably accomplished and always following through with commitments made to sellers.&nbsp; Mike focuses on finding creative solutions leading to sellers achieving their primary objectives in a transaction while establishing the potential for compelling risk adjusted returns to GYS’ stakeholders.&nbsp; Through Mike’s extensive experience acquiring self-storage facilities, he has developed the balance between aggressively seeking acquisition opportunities in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of deal flow and thinking as an owner where filtering out transactions with unrealistic pricing expectations or target acquisitions with poor market presence and lack of ability to provide long term growth, is critical for sustainable success.&nbsp; Further, Mike understands the self-storage industry is a relationship-based asset class.&nbsp; Access to good opportunities is highly dependent on cultivating relationships with owners and their trusted advisors and maintaining an impeccable reputation for being a consistent and reliable buyer. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Mike graduated from Colorado State University with a bachelor’s degree in accounting and finance.&nbsp; Mike and his wife Ashley have three young children and spends his free time trying to keep pace with the kids and finding opportunities to spend a day on the river fly-fishing, big game hunting or skiing.
