Compass HS was present at this weekend’s Winter Farmer’s Market in the Opera Galleria space in Downtown Fort Collins.  Talking to families, sharing our vision and doing a bit of magic, literally.  If interested in meeting any of us and finding out about more about Compass HS, look for us at future Farmers Markets this winter and spring.
