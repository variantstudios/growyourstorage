Students can find information anywhere and everywhere they look.  The truth is, we are all overloaded with information.  What we need is a way to discern whether the information we are consuming is accurate, unbiased, and useful in our quest to making ourselves, our community, and our world a better place for all.

Compass High School is a school for the 21st Century: we ask questions instead of giving answers, we provide resources instead of assignments.
