A quick reminder to our families and friends:

Our building Open House originally scheduled for tonight has been rescheduled due to weather.  The new date/time is Saturday, May 12th from 5-7 pm.  Obviously, same location: 2105 S. College Ave.  Check your calendars.  Invite a friend.  Come check out our space and maybe give your thoughts on a few design components.

Look forward to seeing you all soon.
