Welcome to the Future Campus of Compass Community Collaborative

![](/assets/images/versions/compass-master-plan---x----1000-862x---.jpg)

Endless rows of desks, cinder block hallways, and rigidly-timed buzzers and bells mandating learning’s beginnings and endings are things of education’s past. The future of public education looks very different; Compass Community Collaborative School is joining the ranks of pioneers in the field of secondary education!

The Compass team is thrilled to announce 2105 S. College Avenue as the new home for our school— in the heart of bustling midtown Fort Collins, at a MAX (rapid bus) line stop, and neighbor to Colorado State University, The Gardens on Spring Creek, as well as Whole Foods Market and many other retail partners. We are adjacent to Spring Creek and the associated bike path, and just a short MAX ride away from our downtown business, nonprofit, and civic partners, as well as the Poudre River and Lee Martinez Park. It is the PERFECT place for us to launch our exciting, community-engaged learning!

Our space design is complete and construction is right around the corner. As you can see in the Master Plan above, there are two buildings on this site. Compass will occupy most of the building on the east side and will be united by a courtyard to the building to the west.

The interior of our space has been intentionally designed to invite co-working and collaboration; it will inspire creative expression, and it will support even the messiest moments of problem solving. Large learning studios are balanced with small, quiet study pods. Hands-on construction, engineering, and maker-spaces compliment the open-concept space and flexible work areas.

Compass won’t just look different, it will feel different too! Entering Compass will feel much like entering a professional, coworking incubator. Just as at the Music District or the Rocky Mountain Innosphere, one will find Compass to be a harmoniously bustling, light, positive and healthy environment filled with engaged students, staff, and community members supporting and challenging each other through savvy academic pursuits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Being located on the MAX line will promote the use of public transportation for students from all parts of town getting to and from school each day. We are thrilled to see our school facility begin to take shape over the coming months. Stay tuned for exciting updates!
