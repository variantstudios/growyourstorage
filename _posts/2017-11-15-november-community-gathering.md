On Monday, November 6th, at the Fort Collins Music District, Compass held a community gathering of enrolled students, parents, family members and members of the Compass design team and Governing Board members.&nbsp; It was an incredible opportunity for families to ask questions of the Compass team, share thoughts and ideas for the school opening and for students to engage in Compass-style learning.&nbsp; Over 30 prospective students worked with staff members to explore design and creative thinking and they came away really excited about what school could look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Q/A was thoughtful and too short (we had so many good questions, we didn't get to all of them).&nbsp; We answered questions about everything from our leadership and staff qualifications to our curriculum model.&nbsp; We provided examples of student projects for different levels of students, discussed our fundraising (we just got a $1 million dollar donation!), and began the work of getting our families involved in our school design.&nbsp; It was an amazing night and we look forward to doing it again soon.

We'll announce other events soon.&nbsp; Come back to find out more.
