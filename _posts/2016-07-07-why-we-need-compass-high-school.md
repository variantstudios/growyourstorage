Chloe is a 16 year old who is a new member of our school development team.  She was labeled early in her schooling as a “gifted and talented” student and proved her abilities with straight “A” grades through 9th-grade.  And then she dropped out.  Here is what she has to say about why:

“School turned my focus from learning to getting good grades.  Learning started to take on a very negative connotation for me and I started to do the bare minimum to get good grades….While in high school I constantly felt like I was being forced to work towards someone else’s dream.  I had no sense of purpose whatsoever. I was not interested in what I was studying, and frankly, I didn’t feel like it mattered that I felt this way.”
