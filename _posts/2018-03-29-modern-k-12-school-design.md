As we get closer to the opening of Compass in August, we wanted to share some of the rationale for our campus design.&nbsp; We believe that school culture is everything.&nbsp; One of the most important components of culture is the design of the physical space you occupy.&nbsp; Spaces that encourage collaboration, transparency and technology are paramount.&nbsp; Spaces that invite kids to be themselves and support the school's educational model is just as important.

So if you are interested in why we are designing Compass the way we are, check out this recent [piece from Edutopia on the ideal learning environments](https://www.edutopia.org/article/architecture-ideal-learning-environments) for modern education.&nbsp; Although it was just published earlier this month, you'll find many of the components front and center in the new [Compass campus](https://compassfortcollins.org/campus/) design. From large open, multipurpose spaces and the integration of technology to transparent partitions and "soft" student breakout spaces, the early iteration of Compass will meet the needs of modern students with continued development in the future.
