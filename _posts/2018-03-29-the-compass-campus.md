*UPDATE: Last night (March 29), the Fort Collins City Planning and Zoning Board approved our building at 2105 S. College Ave. with a unanimous vote.&nbsp; The city has been a big supporter from the beginning and the board was excited about the possibilities going forward. Thank you to the members of the Planning and Zoning Board for their important questions, suggestions and overall support.*

We are getting closer every day.

The demolition of the original interior is in process and the future Compass Community Collaborative Campus is being built. If you drive by Whole Foods, you can see the ongoings in the north parking lot.&nbsp; it's exciting.&nbsp; From theory to reality, Compass has come a long way in the past two years.&nbsp; And now we are months from opening.&nbsp; If interested in more information on our campus including the interior design specifications, click [here](https://compassfortcollins.org/campus/).&nbsp;&nbsp;

And please, keep checking our [website](https://compassfortcollins.org/) for more updates including a possible mid-construction Open House and Compass Event coming sometime in April.&nbsp;

Thank you to the Fort Collins community for all of your support in helping us make this happen.

The Compass Executive Team
