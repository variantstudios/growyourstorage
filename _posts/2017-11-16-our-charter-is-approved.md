Last night (November 14th) was a big night for Compass.

After spending the better part of the past two years designing a school model, building a curriculum and doing all of the dirty work of writing and defending our charter application (hundreds of man-hours), the Poudre School District School Board approved our charter with a vote of 7-0.&nbsp; There are a few contingencies (which we expected) but all involved feel great about meeting these standards going forward.

The PSD staff, leadership and school board put in countless hours reviewing our work, giving us needed feedback and challenging us with thoughtful questions.&nbsp; It is evident that the district and school board are invested in us and want to see us succeed.&nbsp; As stated by members of the School Board and the Compass team, we really look forward to continuing our relationship and using our partnership to innovate and learn together.

Thank you to the School Board, PSD staff, PSD Leadership, Compass families and volunteers (too numerous to name), supportive community members and business owners who have partnered with us, CSU and, most importantly, the students who have supported us and invested in us.&nbsp; We can't wait to get started.&nbsp; We've put in a lot of work but the fun begins in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;
